# Fiborest

An basic API REST implementation to get the fibonacci's number according to position.

## Develop

* Install dependencies: `npm i`
* Run using: `npm start`
* Go to: `localhost:3000`


## Testing
* Run tests with: `npm run test`


### Keep it simple

This is only a simple fibonacci's implementation in a API REST, using Express only with one endpoint to get the fibobaccis number.
This has simple validations too.


### Future improvements

* Manage a rooter file to add another endpoints
* More tests maybe
